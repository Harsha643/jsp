        <p>Converse and Cook is about creating social spaces where individuals are empowered to explore their connection to food and their community by creating meals and dining together.</p>

                <h1>Welcome</h1>
             
                <p>* Food is more than a nutritious substance; it identifies us and unites us.</p><br><br>
                <p>* Here at Converse and Cook, we're building community through food.  Read more about our origin story and how we came to be here.</p><br><br>
                <p>* See here if you're interested in partnering with us or having us run programs for your community. If you’re interested in participating in our programming, check out our Instagram page (see below) for when new socials launch. You can also find out when we launch new programs and activities by signing up for our newsletter.</p><br><br>
                <p>* You can also use the three lines on the top left corner to navigate our website.</p><br><br>
            </div>
            <h2>***UPDATE***</h2>
            <div class="update">
                <p>* At the heart of it, Converse and Cook has always been about creating spaces for conversations that lead to connection. But through it all, the sustainability of our programming has been an integral part of our journey to ensure that folks who benefit from the programs we run can continue to do so into the future.</p><br><br>
                <p>* That’s why, in 2024, we made the difficult decision to cease our volunteer program and run fewer cooking socials on our own. Instead, we decided to train and partner with other organizations interested in running similar programming in the communities they are embedded in. We’re still running cooking socials, but in the spaces of these organizations so that one day, they can do these socials independently.</p>
                <p>* These partnerships have allowed Converse and Cook to expand its outreach to allow for more nuanced conversations about culture and community, in a time when these spaces are much needed. We hope that this approach will enable our cooking socials to exist beyond Converse and Cook, ensuring that spaces for these essential conversations over food are never lost.</p>
                <p>* Thank you to the City of Edmonton’s Community Safety Wellbeing Grant for funding our programming. To our partners, thank you for creating spaces for us to connect with folks who are most starved of connection and community. And most importantly, thank you to you, whether a participant or just a supporter, your enthusiasm for the work we do has helped sustain Converse and Cook for over 6 years.</p>
                <p>* 2025 brings new partnerships and excitement. So, watch for when we’re partnering with different organizations to participate in a cooking social in your areas. If you’re a local non-profit or organization that supports underrepresented folks, email us at info@conversecook.com. We might be able to do some cooking socials for the folks you support.</p>

                <p>Converse and Cook is a non-profit organization located in Edmonton, Alberta, CRA number is 725856488RC0001, founded by Juanita Gnanapragasam and Mishma Mukith, both alumni from the University of Alberta,  as a way to get people in our community more engaged with the food that they eat and with each other. We are a non-partisan organization, and our programming is open to all, no matter their identity or skill level.</p>

                <p>Food is much more than a nutritious substance, it connects us with each other, ourselves, and the world around us. Just think about how many of your favourite holidays, experiences, and even knowledge about the world is tied to food?</p>

                    <p>
                    Recognizing that food is a gateway to building bridges in our community, we started ‘Converse and Cook’ to help alleviate barriers people have to finding culturally relevant and nutritious foods. Some of our programming includes running grocery busses, cooking classes, and creating resources on food safety and preparation. Throughout all the programming we run, we encourage people to talk and get to know each other. In fact, ask any of our participants because they’ll tell you that’s the best part of our work!

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Together with volunteers and various support from other non-profits and organizations, we are reducing barriers to culturally nutritious meals and helping people become more connected to food.</p>

                    <p>We’ve had the incredible honour of working with some amazing volunteers over the year.

                    </p>

                    <p>Of our programs listed here we are only running in-person community socials. We prioritize running them in spaces with some sort of kitchen set-up, or we modify the program for spaces without kitchens, as we are keen to help groups run cooking socials on their own.</p>
                    <p>In terms of in-person programming what we would need from you is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Indoor space (we can work in spaces with and without a kitchen! In fact, we’vehosted several socials in classrooms).We do have some money to put towards rent.</li>
                        <li>Access to a bathroom with warm water a soap</li>
                        <li>Access to a sink of some kind</li>
                        <li>* We can also move our socials outdoors in the summer months</li>
                        <li>Promotion of the cooking social to your community members</li>
                        <li>*We’re more than happy for your organization to join in and talk about your great work. (we ask that your staff and volunteers also come and cook with us- trust us, you’ll have better uptake this way)!</li>
